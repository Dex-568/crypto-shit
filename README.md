# crypto-shit
An example of cryptographical ciphers (symmetrical and asymmetrical), not secure at all in real life applications don't use these ever, use libraries instead.


## Current Ciphers

* Caesar Cipher
* Vigenere Cipher

## Cryptanalysis Options

* Caesar Cipher
  * Known Key
  * Unknown Key Brute Force with Chi-Squared Algorithm

* Vigenere Cipher
  * Known Key
 


## TODO

Other cryptanalysis tools like Kasiski Examination/Index Of Coincidence for the Vigenere Cipher
Add other ciphers (Affine, Playfair)
Eventually move onto other cryptographic tools like a Feistel Network/DES or the Enigma
